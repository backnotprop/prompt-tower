# System Discovery & Understanding

Your goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of this codebase so you can effectively contribute to its development. This is a complex system, so take the investigative approach that makes sense to you.

## Objective

Develop a robust mental model of the system's architecture, core workflows, data flow, and key components. Your understanding should be deep enough to confidently tackle diverse development tasks.

## Getting Started

Start with: `tree -a --gitignore --dirsfirst -I '.git'` to map the repository structure, then review recent documentation to understand the current state and what's next to be implemented.

## What You're Building Toward

Once you've explored and synthesized your understanding, provide a structured summary covering:

- **System Overview**: Purpose and high-level architecture
- **Core Workflows**: How compliance tasks flow through the system
- **Key Components**: Major modules and their responsibilities
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where you need clarification or made assumptions

Use whatever discovery approach feels most effective - you have full autonomy over your investigation strategy. Focus on understanding the system deeply enough to contribute meaningfully to its development.

Take your time, think critically, and leverage your strengths in code analysis and pattern recognition. No coding during this phase - pure discovery and understanding.
