## The Problem

Copy-pasting files into Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor one by one. Losing track of context. Getting generic solutions because the AI doesn't understand your architecture. **Sound familiar?**

## The Solution

Select files with checkboxes ‚Üí Generate perfect context ‚Üí Copy to clipboard ‚Üí Paste anywhere.

Prompt Tower packages your codebase‚Äîfiles, directory structure, GitHub issues‚Äîinto AI-optimized prompts. Built for developers using Gemini's 1M context, Cursor's agent, Claude Code, or any AI assistant.

![Demo](https://github.com/backnotprop/prompt-tower/blob/main/assets/prompt-tower-v1.0.0.gif?raw=true)

**[Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=backnotprop.prompt-tower)** ‚Ä¢ Works in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Google IDX

## What You Get

### Visual File Selection

Click checkboxes. See live token counts. No terminal commands or manual file paths.

### Smart Context Packaging

Every prompt includes your project structure:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/GitHubApiClient.ts (5.2KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/FileNode.ts (3.1KB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/TokenCountingService.ts (2.8KB)
```

Plus clean, structured file content:

```xml
<file path="/src/api/GitHubApiClient.ts">
export class GitHubApiClient {
  // Your actual code
}
</file>
```

### Context Control with `.towerignore`

Keep prompts focused. Exclude test fixtures, generated files, or documentation:

```gitignore
tests/fixtures/
dist/
*.test.js
data/
```

### GitHub Issues Integration

Import issues and comments directly. AI understands your problems, not just your code.

### Token Intelligence

Real-time counting prevents surprises. Optimize for any model's limits.
