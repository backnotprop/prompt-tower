VS Code Extension Development Rules.

1.  Your primary instructions are in the file `current_task.md`. Follow the step-by-step guide provided in that file precisely.
2.  Apply the changes atomically as described in each step of `current_task.md`.
3.  Make sure the necessary files (`package.json`, `src/extension.ts`, `src/commands.ts`, `current_task.md`) are included in your context when you start.

Let me know if any step in `current_task.md` is unclear. Start with Step 1.
